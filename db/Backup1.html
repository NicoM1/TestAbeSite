Easy to have a simple chat. Would get complex with multiple people probably</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">oh it has a deep meaning, namely the fact that heroku named it for me</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Hahah that's what I assumed!</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I rather liked it, so I got rid of the 8995 at the end (though that site should still work, you may even be on it)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">test from old site</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Ah no im on the one without the 8995</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I might rename it slickrock if you buy me: http://slickrock.io/</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Haha!</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">oh jeeze that's an expensive domain actually</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I have 0 knowledge of purchasing domains.</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">me neither</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">I have a free .me one from github student pack</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">but I don't want slickrock.me</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Haha I don't do very much web stuff tbh</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">and my portfolio is too ugly to get a new domain for</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">(also nicomay.me is super boring)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">i think nicomay.me would be fine relaly but thats just me haha</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">i need to design myself a website for a portfolio. But first i need to do a bunch of projects to put in this portfolio hahah</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeah, but my portfolio needs a redo, I'm reading a design book right now, so maybe after finishing that</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">which one?</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">design for hackers</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">my current site I was really happy with, now less so</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">i thought it was interesting when i first visited it. I sorta thought there would be more to it, but it's still cool dude!</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">lol I havent done that much, though it is missing my little experiments like this, and the interp</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">but that's honestly about all I've done</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I feel ya! I have a design portfolio from high school but its all old now! Just now getting around to doing some new projects and what not. Trying to explore games but I'm pretty new to it</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">web design or graphic design?</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">general graphic design and a few little illustrations</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">www.behance.net/kowalskymark</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">ah, cool, I honestly don't know your work really as your twitter has no links!</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">ah</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">good timing</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Yeah i keep it on the down low because im not too proud</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">yet</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">i want to improve a lot</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">what's your twitterbase from then? if you don't mind my wondering</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">most is from game development</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">got links? (also I really like your grayscale art and pixels:D)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">i try to reach out to a lot of devs and connect. Trying to learn and make friends, post my own progress, ect. Just started growing.. i dont really know why everyone follows me honestly haha! I used to try and post art every day but.. yeah! x)</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">And thank you! :)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I suck at twitter so I miss everything people post, only tiny bits, I follow too many but don't want to unfollow more</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I suck too trust me, i dont know how i even got past 1k followers or whatever</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">some accounts i notice are other game devs who follow a TON of other accounts in a day to promote their own app, ect. So some of my followers are inactive and pretty much useless. besides making me look good i guess?</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeh but all twitters are like that, same as mine, so just remove that many from everyones followers;)</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">that notification sound is really handy</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeah it is actually! I was going to mention it too x)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">now its like a real chat thing lol</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">still think the UI is a bit plain but that's not my strong suit</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">and I'd feel bad if anyone else did it, so I'll just learn and improve it</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">and what you said is true. Some devs used to follow me (and still do) who got sorta popular. Not sure if that helps "promote" my account on the 'who to follow' thing on twitter.</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">maybe, idk I never am on the normal twitter client (at least on desktop)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">You use tweetdeck?</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeh</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Yeah I used to. i dunno, all the columns started to overwhelm me </div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">but I do like your UI man. It's really simple, but why not?</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">It doesnt need anything else haha.</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">hmm, I just cant deal with talking to people on the normal twitter, also I need the streaming or I won't look at it</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">have you seen pilgrim.io</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">I wasn't thinking of that when I started but I remembered later in, don't want to copy but it sure makes me feel unworthy</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Oh wow. Looks really slick</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">I have been in a similar situation before. Really kills the motivation sometimes</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeh, its crazy slick, and yeah that's the problem with never having a real unique idea:/</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">ugh i feel ya. I'm trying to think of some innovative game ideas lately</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">heh I'm not an idea guy, I just cant do it</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">someday I will make someone elses cool idea and I'll be half satisfyied and half depressed</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Same here. Sometimes i have my moments</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">Be proud you're at least making things though! I haven't done crap lately :(</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">lol i'll get around to it :p</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">not making what I should be though lol, but hey, this works pretty well I'm kinda proud of it</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">I'm glad its fast</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Yeah for sure! I like it around here.</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">for two people its actually a pretty decent im app</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">might need additions if it grew</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeah I think so too.</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">probably rooms like pilgrim has, maintain anonimity but theres no reason you cant go</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem"><strong>Nico:</strong></div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">hola</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeah yeah haha</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem"><strong>Mark:</strong> so yeah I can do this too</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">maybe you can do something with different colors for different users? idk haha.</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I could, just not sure I want to</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">or just color for the little &gt; symbol so its not too much</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">?</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">that's what I had though, but I'm still unsure if I want any other anonymity </div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">sorry</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">un</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">whatever</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Haha i gotcha man</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">like, any refresh would still change your color</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">but that's not the problem</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">that'd be fine</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">idk maybe I'd try it</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeah idk what else. 2 tired 2 brainstorm</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">no, I think that's the best one, that's what I thought too, it was more I'm unsure if I want any separation other than pointers</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">oh course because web is dumb I bet its actually really hard to dynamically color text</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Oh really :|</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">oh wait</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">might have a way, if you stick around 10min I'll try it</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">sure no problem</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">oh dang it I forgot haxe doesn't have a builtin prng, I'm used to always having luxes stuff alongside it</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Also, if you don't wanna play with colors, then how about something like.. user 1 has a &gt;, user 2 has a #, user 3 has a +, user 4 has a ~, ect ect? would that help at all?</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">maybe thats dumb? i dunno haha!</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">think I'm gonna try really subtle grayscale changes;) so its super hard to tell;)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">oooh that would probably look nice :)</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">quick question. what made you choose this width for the input field?</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">idk this isn't what it was before, but I needed it to scale for mobile and didn't want it max width on desktop, but maybe it should be</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">I'll try it</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">i think max width would be cool. but im afraid it wouldn't even seem like a text box at some point. Would people even know to type into it..?</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">I'll do same as mobile, 97%</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">leaves the curve at the right</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">can there be some sort of message in there when it's empty? like how twitter's default tweet box says 'What's happening?"</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">yeh, could do that</div><span>	</span><div class="messageitem">what should it say (should be unique)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">even if its just a really subtle color i think that would be nice. :)</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">idk how to convert colors without a lib, oh wait yes I do but its complicated, I'm not gonna do it right now, also if I push our conversation is gone:'(</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Ahh well, do what you want. That moment there I was almost falling asleep haha, I think I'll talk to you later Nico!</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">have a good night!(:</div><span>&gt;	</span><div class="messageitem">Btw, sorry if it seems like the others dont reply as much.. lame!
